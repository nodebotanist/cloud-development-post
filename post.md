# Cloud Development: How moving your developer environment to the cloud can impact your workflow

Development environments: when you think of them, an individual laptop or desktop usually springs to mind; customized with months or years of library and driver installs, a favorite IDE and/or terminal-- a fingerprint for the developer that uses it on a daily basis. But as the world of software development moves more and more onto the cloud, we need to think about developer environments in ways that better fit the cloud-based way of doing things. This means the idea of the cloud-based development environment; the idea that the developer's physical machine is used as a tool to interact with the developer environment that is now a cloud instance.

Now all this isn't to say we want to take away the individualism of a developer's way of coding; luckily, most IDEs have already started to think in terms of the cloud-based development environment. VS Code has an ssh extension, virtually all terminal IDEs can be easily used on a cloud machine, etc. The point isn't to take away these quintissennial tools of the software development trade-- the argument being made is to essentially use the local machine as a virtual extension of the developer onto the development machine that is now in the cloud. 

Let's dive deeper into the abilities and benefits that using cloud-based development environments gives us.

(Eliminates "works on my machine" by standardizing machines and making them easily sharable)

(Cloud-based dev environments speed up development with beefier machines and easier integration of tools like CI and automated deploys)
